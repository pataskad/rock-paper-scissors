***Rock Paper Scissors***

This project, along the "The Odin Project" curriculum, is a game created, no GUI present for the goals of this current project timeline, for continuing to build on Javascript fundamentals.  

***How it's Ran***

This project is ran in a live environment via the VSCode Live Server Environment to aid in the development and troubleshooting process.

To view this project in a live environment, I recommend using the Live Server extension on VSCode.  Once running, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors (case insensitive)), and open inspector/developer mode and access the console to be able to call all the necessary functions within the scripts.js codebase (or simply call game(); to play a game of rock paper scissors!).

***Skills/Concepts Included Within***

Index.html for structure/outline, scripts.js linked at the bottom of html page.  Scripts.js includes skills and concepts such as Regex matching to parse player selection entry case insensitivity as well as preventing unwanted game choice entries. The game includes multiple if/else style logic statements to properly calculate and account for wins/losses as well as evaluating when the player wins, as well as when the player loses.

***For the Future***

This project will eventually evolve into a game that can be played outside of the console, built with a more thoughtout GUI in the near future.  For now, this project serves the purpose of laying the groundwork and fundamental building blocks that will allow for a more concrete understanding of each function, and more importantly logic, before continuing to lay out and prop up a working GUI to go on top of it for users to interact with.
