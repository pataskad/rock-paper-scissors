***Rock Paper Scissors***

This project, along the "The Odin Project" curriculum, is game created, no GUI present for the goals of this project timeline, for continuing to build on Javascript fundamentals.  

***How it's Ran***

This project is ran in a live environment via the VSCode Live Server Environment to aid in the development and troubleshooting process.

***Skills/Concepts Included Within***

Index.html for structure/outline, scripts.js linked at the bottom of html page.  Scripts.js includes skills and concepts such as Regex matching to parse player selection entry case insensitivity as well as preventing unwanted game choice entries. 

***For the Future***

This project will eventually evolve into a game that can be played outside of the console, built with a more thoughtout GUI at the necessary time.  For now, this project serves the purpose of laying the groundwork and fundamental building blocks that will allow for a more concrete understanding of each function before continuing to lay out and prop up a working GUI to go on top of it.
