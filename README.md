# Rock Paper Scissors #

[Live Demo](https://pataskad.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

This project, along the "The Odin Project" curriculum, is a game created, no GUI present for the goals of this current project timeline, for continuing to build on Javascript fundamentals.  

# How it's Ran #

This project is ran in a live environment via the VSCode Live Server Environment to aid in the development and troubleshooting process.

To view this project in a live environment, I recommend using the Live Server extension on VSCode.  Once running, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors (case insensitive)), and open inspector/developer mode and access the console to be able to call all the necessary functions within the scripts.js codebase (or simply call game(); to play a game of rock paper scissors!).

# Skills/Concepts Included Within #

Index.html for structure/outline, scripts.js linked at the bottom of html page.  Scripts.js includes skills and concepts such as Regex matching to parse player selection entry case insensitivity as well as preventing unwanted game choice entries. The game includes multiple if/else style logic statements to properly calculate and account for wins/losses as well as evaluating when the player wins, as well as when the player loses.

# GUI Update #

The RPS game now also includes a simplified UI for a user to interact with instead of the conventional console through DevTools/inspector mode.  Using the power of Javascript nodes and event method listeners, this game gives users the opportunity to select a an option (r, p, or s) and display the round result, as well as a running tally of wins and losses.  Once the user or computer reaches 5 the game will display a winner or loser message depending on the result of the game. The background will change to green or red depending on what result the user reached through playing the game.  Upon finishing a match, the user can select play again to reset the screen to beginning values along with the starting neutral background.

Enjoy!
